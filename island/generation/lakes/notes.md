# Lake Layer

Uses the regions to designate groups of cells on the triangle grid as under water or land.

Groups cells that are underwater and adjacent into "lakes".

Assigns heights to the "lakes" depending on how far the edges of the lake are from other geometry.

Records the points on the perimeter of each lake.

Also identifies potential outlet points on the perimeter of the lake.
